## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

The platform is designed around a modern Microservices-adjacent architecture. The Node.js Core Backend acts as the orchestrator and central truth, the Python service acts as an isolated heavy-compute node, and the React frontend provides the visualization layer.

### Frontend Ecosystem
- **Framework Flow:** React 18, utilizing functional components and hooks pattern.
- **Bundler:** Vite – chosen for incredibly fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.
- **Routing:** React Router DOM (v6) for seamless client-side single page app transitions and protected route guards.
- **Styling Matrix:** Tailwind CSS – enabling rapid, inline utility styling ensuring visual consistency.
- **Animation Engine:** Framer Motion – responsible for all complex layout transitions, gesture detections, and the premium "glassmorphism" micro-interactions that make the app feel alive.
- **Icons & Data Viz:** Lucide React for consistent, crisp SVG iconography, and scalable abstractions for charting elements.
- **API Client:** Axios, configured with central interceptors to automatically inject authorization headers.

### Backend Ecosystem
- **Runtime:** Node.js (v18+)
- **Server Framework:** Express.js – lightweight handler for RESTful routes and middleware pipelines.
- **Database:** MariaDB – High performance relational database handling complex table joins and atomic transactions.
- **Driver:** `mariadb` Node package, using Connection Pooling for concurrent request handling.
- **Authentication:** `jsonwebtoken` (JWT) and `bcryptjs`.
- **Environment:** `dotenv` for secure 12-factor app configuration.

### Machine Learning Component
- **Runtime:** Python 3.9+
- **API Server:** FastAPI – lightning-fast ASGI python framework handling the inference endpoints. Served via Uvicorn.
- **Data Engineering:** Pandas & NumPy for matrix operations and historical array normalization.
- **Modeling Algorithms:**
  - Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression) for basic stock-out predictions.
  - Statsmodels (Exponential Smoothing) for robust time-series demand forecasting.
  - Scikit-Learn (KMeans) for product cluster velocity classification.
  - Scikit-Learn (Isolation Forest) for anomalous dead stock detection.
- **Validation:** Pydantic for strict incoming REST payload typing.

## 🗺️ System Architecture Details

The typical data flow through the architecture looks like this:

1. **User Request:** The React SPA attempts to view the *Dashboard*.
2. **Gateway:** Axios intercepts the request, attaches the user's encoded JWT, and fires an XHR request to the Node `/api/analytics/dashboard` endpoint.
3. **Middleware Intercept:** Express router `authMiddleware` validates the JWT signature against the server's `JWT_SECRET`. If valid, it unpacks the user payload and role, attaching it to `req.user`.
4. **Relational Query:** The Controller opens a connection pool thread to MariaDB and runs a complex query isolating active inventory alerts and capital sums.
5. **Microservice Hand-off:** For predictive graphs, the Node server acts as a client, constructing historical sales arrays and issuing an internal system `.post` to the Python FastAPI container (`/predict/stock-out`).
6. **Inference:** Python crunches the dataset in memory utilizing NumPy, generates a regression trendline via Scikit-Learn, and responds with JSON integers.
7. **Resolution:** Node aggregates the DB and ML data, and responds to the frontend.
8. **Render:** Framer Motion animates the DOM entry of the returned KPI statistics within the Glassmorphism UI components.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you can build the Smart Inventory platform locally, ensure you have the following global dependencies installed:

1. **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher.
2. **NPM or Yarn**: Node package managers.
3. **Python**: v3.9 or higher (Ensure `pip` is available).
4. **MariaDB**: v10.6 or higher (MySQL 8.0+ is broadly compatible).


---

## 💻 Local Development Setup

To run the entire system locally, you will need to operate three separate terminal processes.

### 1. Database Configuration

You must have a MariaDB instance running locally (default port 3306). 

If you are using Docker you could spin one up quickly:
```bash
docker run -p 3306:3306 --name inventory-db -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mariadb:latest
```

Navigate to the node backend:
```bash
cd backend
```

Create or modify your `.env` file to match your MariaDB credentials:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_db_password
DB_NAME=smart_inventory
JWT_SECRET=generate_something_extremely_secure_here
PORT=5000
ML_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Run the automated bootstrapping script. This connects to your database instance, creates the `smart_inventory` database schema, builds all the tables, and creates necessary associations.
```bash
node setupDb.js
```
*(You should see "Database and tables created successfully" in the console).*

### 2. Node.js Backend API

Once the database is constructed, we start the API Router.
Still in the `/backend` directory:

```bash
# Install node packages
npm install

# Start the development server (uses nodemon if available for hot-reloads)
npm run dev
# OR native execution
node server.js
```
The Express server will boot up and bind to `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Python ML Microservice

Open a **new terminal tab**. Navigate to the ML service directory.

```bash
cd ml-service
```

Determine your virtual environment and build it. Keeping Python dependencies isolated is critical for ML stacks.

```bash
# Initialize a new Virtual Environment named 'venv'
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (WINDOWS OS)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate it (MAC/LINUX OS)
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the scientific computing and server packages.
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn scikit-learn pandas numpy pydantic python-dotenv mariadb
```

Start the ASGI server:
```bash
# Runs the app Object located inside main.py with hot-reloading
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
FastAPI will now be running on `http://localhost:8000`. The automated interactive swagger documentation is instantly available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### 4. React Frontend Web Application

Open a **third terminal tab**. Navigate into the frontend ecosystem.

```bash
cd frontend
```

Configure your environment settings. Ensure the `.env` (or `.env.local` for Vite) contains the correct API mapping:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Install React ecosystem dependencies and launch the dev server:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Vite will instantly boot on `http://localhost:5173`. Open this URL in your browser to interact with the full system!

## 🔗 API Documentation

The Node API follows robust RESTful conventions. Responses are JSON serialized. 

### Authentication Flow
The API is generally locked down securely.

- `POST /api/auth/register` : Accepts `{ name, email, password, role }`. Hashes the password utilizing bcrypt with 10 salt rounds and creates a new system `USER`. *(Note: in production, registration endpoints should be either locked to admin token holders or require email verification workflows, to avoid public role escalation attacks).*
- `POST /api/auth/login` : Accepts `{ email, password }`. Generates a signed `JWT` payload structured as `{ id, email, role }` valid for 24h.

To authenticate future requests, append the token in the headers:
```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_string>
```

### Core Endpoints

*Note: Assume all below endpoints require a valid JWT header.*

**Products (`/api/products`)**
- `GET /` : Returns full catalog with joined category and supplier names.
- `POST /` : `[RBAC: owner, manager]` Creates a new un-instanced global catalog item. Requires `sku`, `name`, `cost_price`, `selling_price`.
- `DELETE /:id`: `[RBAC: owner, manager]` Hard deletes an item from global catalogs.

**Inventory (`/api/inventory`)**
- `GET /` : Returns granular locations mapping of product counts. Effectively answers "How many of SKU #123 are physically in Warehouse A vs Shop B?". Resolves joined readable strings.

**Stock Movements (`/api/stock-movements`)**
- `GET /` : Returns chronological audit ledger.
- `POST /` : `[RBAC: owner, manager, warehouse_operator]` Crucial endpoint. Accepts `{ product_id, location_id, type (IN/OUT/ADJUSTMENT/TRANSFER), quantity, reference }`. 
  - **Logic Interceptor:** Initiates MariaDB locking transactions. It finds the current tally for that product/location matrix. It accurately adds or subtracts the requested payload. It commits the `STOCK_MOVEMENTS` log and updates `INVENTORY` synchronously to avoid database race conditions.

**Purchase Orders (`/api/purchase-orders`)**
- `GET /` : Retrieves the PO pipeline.
- `POST /` : `[RBAC: owner, manager]` Initiates a multi-step transaction creating a primary `PURCHASE_ORDER` row tied to a supplier, and sequentially injects `PURCHASE_ORDER_ITEMS` referencing global products.

**Intelligence Analytics (`/api/analytics`)**
- `GET /dashboard` : Performs high-intensity aggregate queries across the whole database determining Total Capital Valuation of stocked items, aggregating counts of Low Stock Alerts (comparing actual vs. reorder limits per product), and tracking overall Pending workflows.
- `GET /predictions/:product_id` : Acts as an API Gateway proxy. Contacts the internal network Python Microservice with synthesized sales vectors, returning the ML algorithmic predictions directly to the requesting client dashboard smoothly.


---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Overview

The ML service (`ml-service/main.py`) acts as the forecasting brains. Because inventory data is highly numeric and tabular, we utilize Scikit-Learn structures and Statsmodels over heavy deep-learning frameworks (which would add unnecessary overhead).

- **Current Implementation Strategy:**
  - **Stock-Out & EOQ (`/predict/stock-out`):** Evaluates daily sale velocity trend and calculates the optimal Economic Order Quantity based on holding and ordering costs.
  - **Demand Forecasting (`/forecast/demand`):** Employs the `statsmodels` library to extrapolate 7, 14, and 30-day time series demand curves.
  - **Velocity Classification (`/classify/products`):** Uses `KMeans` clustering (`n_clusters=3`) to segment products into Fast, Medium, and Slow moving based on turnover rate and sales variance.
  - **Dead Stock Detection (`/detect/dead-stock`):** Feeds current inventory holding vs days-since-last-sale into an `IsolationForest` to flag true stagnant capital vs standard slow-movers.
  
This service is stateless, inherently horizontally scalable via Docker or Kubernetes when prediction traffic increases, separating ML scaling bottlenecks away from primary CRUD operations.


---

## 🛡️ User Roles & Permissions

The platform includes hard-coded RBAC middleware. The roles enforce operational security on physical inventory manipulation.

1. **`owner`**: God-mode. Complete read, write, execution, deletion rights across the system footprint, accessing analytics and managing user generation.
2. **`manager`**: Operational control. Can view comprehensive catalogs, approve Purchase Orders, define categories, dictate global transfer movements, and manage the underlying location parameters.
3. **`warehouse`**: Execution capabilities. Restricted view of financial figures (they see quantity, not necessarily cost valuation totals), but possesses rights to execute physical `STOCK IN` and `STOCK OUT` operational movements natively on the ledger.
4. **`staff`**: Sales terminal restrictions. Read privileges to view where stock is across locations to inform customers, capability to mark out a sale (`STOCK OUT`).


---

## 🎨 UI / UX Design Principles

A massive focus during development was applied to preventing the "ugly enterprise" software trope. The User Interface utilizes specific high-end patterns to feel comparable to Premium SaaS platforms.

- **Theme Palette:** Deep slate and dark mode foundations (`slate-900`/`slate-800`), ensuring long analytical sessions cause minimal optical fatigue. The high contrast allows color-coded KPI badges (Red=Warning, Emerald=Good, Amber=Pending) to pop and draw eye attention intuitively.
- **Glassmorphism:** Leveraging Tailwind's `/80` opacity variables and `backdrop-blur-md` matrices to create depth stacking. The primary sidebar and top-bars blur the animated ambient background mesh gradients behind them.
- **Micro-Interactions (Framer Motion):** 
  - Elements do not simply load; they `fade and slide-up` sequentially generating organic build-in rhythms.
  - Sidebar routing elements utilize `layoutId` physics boxes to trace and follow mouse focus fluidly.
  - Core CTA (Call to Action) buttons employ custom spring matrices on `whileHover` and `whileTap` states to offer profound haptic feedback on digital click.
- **Form Geometry:** Complete abandonment of sharp 90-degree boxes in favor of `.rounded-xl` and `.rounded-2xl` structural geometry across input structures, rendering a softer, cleaner form interface. 
- **Skeleton Ready:** Core UI frames inherently load their architecture instantly via component isolation, ensuring the user immediately sees the page structure while Axios resolves heavy backend joins and hydrates the layout.


---

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **SQL Injection Armor:** Prepared statements are strictly utilized across all MariaDB Driver queries (e.g. `.query('SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE id = ?', [id])`), destroying injection probability.
2. **No Storage of Defaults:** Passwords are mathematically converted to randomized one-way hashes via `.genSalt(10)` before resting in memory.
3. **Stateless Scale Auth:** No server-side session memory. The Node box can restart infinite times flawlessly because JWT validations happen independently via secret key verification of incoming payload signatures.
4. **CORS Sanitization:** Cross-Origin Request filters active by default within `express` middleware setups preventing cross-domain hijacking routines.


---

## ☁️ Deployment Strategy

The application is structurally prepped for standard cloud matrices.

**Frontend (Vercel / Netlify / Cloudflare Pages)** 
- Static Site Generators / Single Page Apps are optimized here.
- Execute `npm run build` in the Vite `/frontend` environment, dropping the resulting `dist` folder natively to any CDNs edge.

**Backend Node API (Render / Railway / Heroku / AWS EC2)**
- Containerized or native Node deployment. Ensure `process.env.PORT` dynamically binds to the host's port requirements.

**Python Microservice (Render / DigitalOcean App Platform)**
- Isolated process execution allowing scale thresholds to be tied to CPU spikes associated with Inference matrix calculations natively separate from Node.

**Database (AWS RDS / PlanetScale / Managed Cloud)**
- Abstract the database architecture out of the VM spaces and onto a managed resilient relational layer preventing localized crashes from deleting core ledger logs.


---

## 🔭 Future Enhancements

While comprehensive, modern architectures are never statically finished. Key integrations slated for upcoming version releases:
- **Websocket Realtime Protocol:** Exchanging standard Axios pulls with `socket.io` to ensure Live-Dashboard metric ticks across all warehouse operators synchronously upon physical item scans natively.
- **Barcode & RFID Pipeline:** Re-engineering frontend Search fields to natively intercept USB & Bluetooth peripheral input events (Barcode lasers) triggering instant SKU database mutations.
- **Advanced Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** Maturing the FastAPI container from simple Scikit-Learn linear regression into deeply convoluted `Tensorflow/LSTMs` for extremely complex seasonal curve forecasting capable of anticipating holiday volume swings implicitly.
- **CSV & Excel Export Layer:** Utilizing libraries to dump structured DataFrames of the dashboard matrices for accountant use.
